      Deciding what to write in a holiday card in 2020 is...weird, like the rest
      of this year. We are extra grateful for you - our awesome friends and
      family who have helped us stay (virtually) sane. Buying our dream house
      this year was also a huge plus, and we look forward to hosting you here
      someday, hopefully soon! Other than buying a house, nothing new to report
      on. We are happy to be healthy and safe and hope the same for you and your
      family. Take care and see you in 2021.

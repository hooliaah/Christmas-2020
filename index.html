          Deciding what to write in a holiday card in 2020 is...weird, just like
          the rest of this year. We are extra grateful for you - our awesome
          friends and family who have helped us stay (virtually) sane. Buying
          our dream house this year was also a huge plus, and we look forward to
          hosting you here someday, hopefully soon! We are happy to be healthy
          and safe and hope the same for you and your family. Take care and see
          you in 2021.
